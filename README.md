UNIX Bootstrap
===

Are you tired of looking for UNIX tools and tutorials and coming upon pages that look like somebody spent time styling them? Let's be honest: this hardly inspires confidence in the content on the page. In fact, for UNIX afficianados, the result is precisely the opposite.

Enter **UNIX Bootstrap**, a powerful, cutting-edge new CSS library that enables you to design UNIX pages for UNIX devotees!

Just what kinds of things can you do with UNIX Bootstrap? Well, let's dive in!

#### Make a banner using the `banner` class

Turn this mess

<h4>Welcome to my awk tutorial!</h4>

into GOLD:

<h1 style="background-color:#e0e0ff;border: 1px solid black;color: blue;">Welcome to my awk tutorial!</h1>

#### Text done right

Here's some plain text  

<a href="#" style="color: blue">Here's a fresh link</a>

<a href="#" style="color: purple">Here's a visited link</a>

<a href="#" style="color: red">And here's when you hover!</a>

#### Spice up your font with the `fancy` class

Turn this plain Jane text…

<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">…into this hot dynamite!</p>

#### Let's set the mood with the `ambience` class

Here's a `<div>` without ambience…

<div style="background-color: #2E9AFE">…and here's one with it!</div>

#### Putting some umph into your arrows with the `green-arrow` class

Here are some boring arrows:

»»»»»»»»

And here are some confident, shimmering ones!

<p style="color: #006600">»»»»»»»»</p>
